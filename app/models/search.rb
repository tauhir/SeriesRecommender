		# Should get all recommended for each liked and then list by most occured. 
		# For now we're not taking into account the following:
		# genre, origin country, age, actors.

		# The general idea here is the following:
		# 	have two arrays, one to iterate through and one 2d array with each recommends list
		# 	From the iterating array, we need to remove the duplicates and disliked shows
		# 	We can then iterate through the array and look for a show in the 2d array
		# 	wherever we find a 2d array we can determine the position of the total like
		# 	We can add this up for each list and divide by the total to get the recommended (1 - result because lowest is higher here) like below:
		# 		 1 - (pos1/total1 + pos2/total2 + pos3/total3 ...)/total lists to get liked percentage 
		# 		in above, if value is not in a list use 1.1 as its worse than being last (arb number lol ) @todo get better way then 1.1
		# 	The results can be made into a hash or something and will determine order
		# 	This will update whenever a user likes/dislikes something
